# Application Name
The name for my web application will be **Weight Journey**. 

# Project Topic/Objective
The web application I want to create is a weight tracker application. The objective of my web application is to keep track of a user's weight loss and weight gain. The user will enter their weight periodically and the application will store it. The web application will also display the user's weight in a graph. The graph will allow the user to see their weight loss and or weight gain over a period. 


# Motivation
This project is of interest to me because I am currently on a weight loss journey. This application will allow me to keep track of my weight loss. My weight fluctuates a lot, making it difficult to keep track of all the changes. Because my weight changes so often, it is difficult to see how much weight I lose over a period of time just by looking at the numbers. The graph that will be displayed in the application will be particularly useful because it will allow me to see whether I achieve my goal of losing a certain amount of weight by a certain period. 


# Server-Side Components
Users' login information along with their weight entries will be stored in a database.
